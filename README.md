# Streams
Stream utilities for JavaScript/TypeScript.

* **This is a project that I made as a hobby while learning TypeScript. Sudden breaking changes and management that do not take into account distribution may occur. If you want long-term retention, plese fork or copy.**

* **I don't understand English very well. I use a translation tool. I'm sorry if the sentence is wrong.**
